Microsoft SQL Server Query Generator

It's for those who can't seems to Generate Script using SQL Server Management Studio.
With this easy to use and simple software, you'll get to generate script.

Script generated will be saved on the same dir as the application. Similarly, you need to
modify connString.txt in order to allow the application to access your database.

Console Application made simple to save asses. This was done in order to get my Database queries because
I used an application to populate my database, thus I needed an application to generate a populate script
with the information in my database.


HOW TO USE:

1) Modify the connString.txt to your database source.

2) Input the column name that you intend to take the source from. (Exclude IDENTITY column)

3) Input the table name that the column belong to.

4) Input the filename which the program will save it as. (IGNORE the filetype; Example: SQLScriptPopulate - YOU DO NOT NEED THE FILE TYPE)

5) TYPE START TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF GENERATING THE QUERY.
